XBRL Abstract Model in RDF&amp;OWL

XBRL Abstract Model is documented by XBRL International Inc. as Public Working Draft in June 2012. Whereas the abstract model is pictured as UML graphs, it is important to realize the idea in some specific way to proceed the discussion and increase the reality of sematnic modeling on XBRL. This repository aims to realize the XBRL Abstract Model using Semantic Web technologies and OWL ontology languages.
